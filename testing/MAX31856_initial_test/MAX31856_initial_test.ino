// Library Implementation Details
// ==============================
// DRDY and FAULT lines are not used in this driver. DRDY is useful for low-power mode so samples are only taken when
// needed; this driver assumes power isn't an issue.  The FAULT line can be used to generate an interrupt in the host
// processor when a fault occurs.  This library reads the fault register every time a reading is taken, and will
// return a fault error if there is one.  The MAX31856 has sophisticated usage scenarios involving FAULT.  For
// example, low and high temperature limits can be set, and the FAULT line triggers when these temperatures are
// breached. This is beyond the scope of this sample library.  The assumption is that most applications will be
// polling for temperature readings - but it is good to know these features are supported by the hardware.
//
// The MAX31856 differs from earlier thermocouple IC's in that it has registers that must be configured before
// readings can be taken.  This makes it very flexible and powerful, but one concern is power loss to the IC.  The IC
// should be as close to the cold junction as possible, which might mean there is a cable connecting the breakout
// board to the host processor.  If this cable is disconnected and reconnected (MAX31856 loses power) then the
// registers must be reinitialized.  This library detects this condition and will automatically reconfigure the
// registers.  This simplifies the software running on the host.
//
// A lot of configuration options appear in the .H file.  Of particular note is the line frequency filtering, which
// defaults to 60Hz (USA and others).  If your line voltage is 50Hz you should set CR0_NOISE_FILTER_50HZ.
//
// This library handles the full range of temperatures, including negative temperatures.
//
// When connecting the thermocouple, remember the 2 wires are polarized.  If temperatures go up when you expect
// them to go down just reverse the wires.  No damage will be done to the MAX31856.

// The power requirement for the board is less than 2mA.  Most microcontrollers can source or sink a lot more
// than that one each I/O pin.  For example, the ATmega328 supports up to 20mA.  So it is possible to power the
// board using I/O pins for power - so you can turn the board on and off (if you want to).
